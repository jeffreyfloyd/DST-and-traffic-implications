A study into the effects of daylight savings on traffic incidents in the city of Chicago, IL

Data Obtained From: https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents

## Problem Statement
We have been contracted by a rideshare company to look into the impacts of the spring and fall Daylight Savings Time changes on traffic accidents. To accomplish this we will be using Sobhan Moosaviâ€™s US Accidents dataset that has gathered ~ 1.5 million US traffic accidents from February 2016 to December of 2020. The goal of this project will be to develop a model that can predict the severity (on a 1-4 scale) of a given traffic accident, and then deploy that model for use in real-time. 

## Background
