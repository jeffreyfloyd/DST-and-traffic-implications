## From Assignment: Requirements ##
**For the purposes of a DSI project, we met a few technical requirements. They are:**

1. A README.md file in your project repo. Note that README files are automatically rendered by GitHub when you view a repo. Your README should contain:
    - A problem statement.
    - A succinct formulation of the question your analysis seeks to answer.
    - A table of contents, which should indicate which notebook or scripts a stakeholder should start with, and a link to an executive summary.
    - A paragraph description of the data you used, plus your data acquisition, ingestion, and cleaning steps.
    - A short description of software requirements (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn) required by your analysis.

2. Your notebook(s) should be reproducible and error-free. This means:
    - You should set a random seed at the start of every notebook. This will ensure that the random numbers generated in your notebook will be the same every time.
    - You need to provide a relative path to your data, so that if I clone your repo to my machine I can run everything in your repo without error. (You also provide links to any publicly accessible data.)
    - I should be able to Restart & Run All in your notebook(s) and see that the exact same results are reproduced.
    - To check that everything worked properly, you may consider forking your own repo to a different location on your computer and checking that all notebooks can run properly from top to bottom.

3. Bear in mind that the value you provide may come from data ingestion, data cleaning, EDA, and/ or a dashboard, etc. While a model may not be immediately apparent, be creative. Without us telling you exactly what model to build, how could you build a model to increase performance or generate better insights when answering the problem you are facing?

## Problem Statement
We have been contracted by a rideshare company to look into the impacts of the spring and fall Daylight Savings Time changes on traffic accidents. To accomplish this we will be using Sobhan Moosaviâ€™s US Accidents dataset that has gathered ~ 1.5 million US traffic accidents from February 2016 to December of 2020. The goal of this project will be to develop a model that can predict the severity (on a 1-4 scale) of a given traffic accident, and then deploy that model for use in real-time.
